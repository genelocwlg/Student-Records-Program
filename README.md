This is a simple Student Records Management program using Python and Tkinter. It was made to make storing and managing student information easier, cleaner and faster!

The app lets you add, view, edit, and remove student records through a friendly interface. Data is saved automatically using a JSON file, so records stay even after closing the program 💾

✨ What this project is about
